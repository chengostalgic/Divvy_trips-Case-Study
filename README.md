# Divvy_trips-Case-Study
This case study analyzes two quarters of Divvy Trips data from 2019 and 2020. The data is from a fake bicycle company that wants more people to become members so that the company can earn more profit. I took the data, cleaned it to merge the two sets of data, then analyzed how casual user and member behavior differ. In the cleaning process, there were some missing and impossible values in the datasets, so I had to remove those values. I used R to make some visualizations of patterns I thought would be interesting. By analyzing the patterns of both, I saw that members use the bicycles much longer and often than casual users do. The most common times to use the bikes are at around 7:00 AM and around 4:00 PM. To gain more members, advertising could be targeted towards people who have a much greater need to use bicycles as well as during the two specified time periods.
